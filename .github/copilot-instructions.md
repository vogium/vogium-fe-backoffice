We are developing frontend applications, so please tailor your responses and code samples to align with React frontend framework.

We always write JavaScript and TypeScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

We use camelCase for variable naming.
Use short and proper variable naming can be understood at first glance.
